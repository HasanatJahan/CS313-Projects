# Data Structures Class Projects 
This repository contains labs and projects done in the Data Structures course.

## Notable projects:
## CS313-Project1: Polynomial Calculator 
This polynomial calculator takes a user input polynomial expression, determines that the input is a valid polynomial expression and then evaluates the expression. 

## CS313-Project3: Expression Tree Evaluation 
An expression tree is created from an input polynomial expression and the expression is evaluated accordingly. 

#### This also contains multiple other project implementations exploring data structures:
- stacks
- queues
- trees (binary and AVL)
- heaps
- graphs
- hash tables
- Searching and sorting algorithms
